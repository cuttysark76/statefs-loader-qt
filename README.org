* Statefs Qt providers loader

Some Qt components/code need main Qt event loop to be running and it
should be started in the thread where some (read any) Qt code was
used, it saves current thread as the main thread. So, this loader
create QCoreApplication and starts its event loop in a dedicated
thread. When event loop is started requested provider can be loaded
safely.
